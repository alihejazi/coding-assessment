# Technical Test

We would like to test your problem solving skills. There are four exercises:

- middle: Return the middle character(s) of a string.
- compromised: Return the 'outlier' N of an array.
- swap: Swap elements of an array.
- increment: Increment the last number in a string.

### Details

The examples are in JavaScript. You can complete them in a different language if you prefer.

We will start with `middle.js` and work our way through that exercise.

Once middle has been completed, we will move on to another exercise.

Please feel free to google, ask us questions, and install libraries that may help you. Getting the answer from AI is not allowed ðŸ˜ƒ.

Have fun!
